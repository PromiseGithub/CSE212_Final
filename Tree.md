# **Introduction**
#### This type of data structure is like a liknked  list in terms of connecting with each other with pointers. The difference is that in Trees, a node can connect to multiple different nodes. The connecting lines or pointers in Trees are called edge(s). Other unique fetures of this data structure is the components that it's made of. These includes
* Subtree
* Root Node
* Parent Node
* Child Node
* Leaf Node

Before we dive in into what we have for Trees, there are few important terms that you have to familiarize yourself with.

**Subtree:** This comsist of a node that serves as a root to other nodes while being attached to a bigger tree. As the name implies, this is a tree in a tree. \
**Node:** This major component of a tree are either pointing to other similar entities or are being pointed to. They also contain the values that are asscociated with trees. \
**Root:** This is also known as the root node and it's the very first node in a tree.
